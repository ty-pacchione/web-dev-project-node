# CS4550 Project Node Server
This is the back-end Node server for the [JobSearch](https://github.com/ty-pacchione/web-dev-project) project. The server uses the Express library to listen for commands from the web app and interacts with a remote MongoDB database. The website features several user interactions with the data from the database and supports simultaneous user sign-ins.
